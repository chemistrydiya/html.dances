        <p>Ballroom dance is a type of partner dance originating at the end of the sixteenth century in France. Commonly used as shorthand for any partner dance, ballroom has today evolved into two main subgenres – standard/smooth and Latin/rhythm.

            Dances within these categories include the waltz, tango and foxtrot, and pasodoble, bolero and samba.
            
            Ballroom is a popular form of competitive dance, or dancesport, with competitions being held all over the world.</p>
